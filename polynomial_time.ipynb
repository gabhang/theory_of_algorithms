    "# The Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P)\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The complexity class P refers to a collection of decision problems that can be **easily checked or solved** by an algorithm within a **polynomial amount of time**. This implies that the running time of the algorithm **increases proportionally** to a polynomial function of the *input size*. As a result, polynomial time algorithms are typically deemed as **efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational complexity theory, P is a *fundamental complexity class* that includes many significant problems in computer science and mathematics, such as addition, sorting, searching, and matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "P is a *subset of NP*, which involves problems that can be verified within a polynomial amount of time but might **not** necessarily be solved in polynomial time. The relationship between P and NP is a *major unresolved issue* in theoretical computer science, known as the **P vs NP problem**.\n",
    "\n",

    "As shown, there are many complexity classes other than P and NP that each corresponds to *certain computational problems* with related **complexity and resources** required. **Time and space** are commonly used to determine how complex a problem is. *Time complexity* is used to indicate the number of steps required to solve a problem and to verify the answer. On the other hand, *space complexity* describes the amount of memory needed for the algorithm to function."
