    "# The Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P)\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The complexity class P refers to a collection of decision problems that can be **easily checked or solved** by an algorithm within a **polynomial amount of time**. This implies that the running time of the algorithm **increases proportionally** to a polynomial function of the *input size*. As a result, polynomial time algorithms are typically deemed as **efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational complexity theory, P is a *fundamental complexity class* that includes many significant problems in computer science and mathematics, such as addition, sorting, searching, and matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "P is a *subset of NP*, which involves problems that can be verified within a polynomial amount of time but might **not** necessarily be solved in polynomial time. The relationship between P and NP is a *major unresolved issue* in theoretical computer science, known as the **P vs NP problem**.\n",

    "As shown, there are many complexity classes other than P and NP that each corresponds to *certain computational problems* with related **complexity and resources** required. **Time and space** are commonly used to determine how complex a problem is. *Time complexity* is used to indicate the number of steps required to solve a problem and to verify the answer. On the other hand, *space complexity* describes the amount of memory needed for the algorithm to function.\n",

    "In this context, *four* common complexity classes will be discussed further:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P**: The term P in P class stands for **Polynomial Time**. This class contains decision problems (with a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer) that can be *solved* in *polynomial Turing machine*, also known as *deterministic Turing machine*. As mentioned previously, P class problems have solutions that are **easily obtainable** and can be **verified easily**.\n",
    "- **NP**: The Non-deterministic Polynomial Time class comprises decision problems that can be solved in a *non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time* or in a *deterministic Turing machine in exponential time*. In NP class, computational problems **cannot be solved easily** but can be **verified easily** in polynomial time. For instance, graph isomorphism is a NP class problem as it is still unsolvable in polynomial time and can be solved using *brute-force approach* which takes exponential time. A demonstration can be found in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/gabhang/graph_theory/blob/main/graph-isomorphism.ipynb) which discusses **P vs NP problem** as well.\n",
    "- **NP-Complete**: NP-Complete problems are **both NP and NP-Hard**. Problems in NP-Complete class are the difficult ones in NP class. Therefore, if any of the problems in NP-Complete can be solved in polynomial time, it would imply that all problems in NP class can be solved in polynomial time too. \n",
    "- **NP-Hard**: A problem that is classfied as NP-hard is **at least as difficult** as the problem in NP class. It is vital to note that *not* all NP-Hard problems are in NP as visualised in the figure above. It takes a big amount of time to verify if an NP-hard problem is right or not.\n",
