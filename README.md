# Theory of Algorithms

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook created as part of a fourth year software development module, Theory of Algorithms, in Atlantic Technological University. This module provides an overview to the theory of algorithms, focusing on computation and computability. 

# Overview

**The Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P)**

Polynomial class algorithms are a family of algorithms that solve problems on polynomial classes of graphs. These algorithms are known to have polynomial time complexity and have wide applications in fields like graph theory, computational biology, and computer vision.

The Jupyter notebook included in this repository provides an introduction to polynomial class algorithms and explores their complexity in the context of the project requirements. The notebook also includes Python code examples that demonstrate the implementation of these algorithms and their performance in various scenarios.
